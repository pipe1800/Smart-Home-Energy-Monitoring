Auth
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/login \  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \  -d "username=test2@gmail.com&password=test123"

Collecting workspace informationLooking at your codebase, I can see that your services are running in Docker containers with specific port mappings. Based on your docker-compose.yml file, here's how the services are mapped:

- **Auth Service**: Internal port 8000 → External port 8000
- **Telemetry Service**: Internal port 8000 → External port 8001  
- **AI Service**: Internal port 8000 → External port 8002

The issue is that your services are running on their internal port 8000, but are exposed on different external ports. When using curl, you need to use the external ports.

Here are the correct curl commands for each service:


# Register
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test10@gmail.com", "password": "test123456"}'

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=test2@gmail.com&password=test123456"

# Get devices (requires auth token)
curl -X GET http://localhost:8001/devices \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"

# Create device
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/devices \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{"name": "Test Device", "type": "appliance", "room": "living_room", "power_rating": 1.5}'

# Check status
curl http://localhost:8002/ai

# Query AI (requires auth token)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/ai/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{"question": "What is my current energy usage?"}'

# Check if services are responding
curl http://localhost:8000/auth
curl http://localhost:8001/
curl http://localhost:8002/ai
